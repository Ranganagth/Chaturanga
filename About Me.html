        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello,</p>
        <p>Thank you for checking out this part of the site. Your curiosity sets you apart, making you unique.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm Ranganath V, an engineering student at the National Institute of Engineering, Mysore.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I warmly welcome you to try this chess game, designed to help you practice and train to become the best in
            chess. This project aims to create a practical and usable product that functions both as software and an
            educational tool. It is designed without restrictions and is based on my personal understanding of the game.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unlimited Practice:</strong> You can practice an unlimited number of times, gaining more
                knowledge and improving your skills with each game.</li>
            <li><strong>Player vs. Computer Analysis:</strong> This project analyzes the player's approach against a
                computer opponent, offering a dynamic and open-ended model that encourages creative interaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Judgmental Environment:</strong> This system won't judge or complain about numerous practice
                attempts, allowing you to train freely and improve at your own pace.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong Engine:</strong> The game engine is robust and finds all possible ways to win. If you
                lose to the system, don't worry â€“ you are still improving and becoming better in your own way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Happy gaming!</p>
